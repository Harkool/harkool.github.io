About Me
======
刘昊  
Hao, Liu

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism at the State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, working at the intersection of computational pharmacology and artificial intelligence. My research focuses on applying advanced machine learning techniques to drug discovery, particularly for challenging therapeutic targets, and developing AI-driven approaches for pharmacokinetic modeling and clinical decision support. I am fortunate to be supervised by Academician [Guangji Wang](https://www.cae.cn/cae/html/main/colys/41733597.html) and Professor [Guo Yu](https://ygl.cpu.edu.cn/gmis5/dsfc/dsfcgrxx/D505D9EA25B7E8E3FCA77DEC1F03C908) from China Pharmaceutical University, and Professor [De-chuan Zhan](https://www.yuque.com/zhandc/home/nk8z4o) from the School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research bridges computational methods and pharmaceutical applications, with emphasis on:

**Primary Focus: AI-Driven Drug Discovery for Challenging Targets**
- Computational design and optimization of therapeutic peptides (antimicrobial peptides, cell-penetrating peptides)
- Integration of multimodal deep learning, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary algorithms
- Multi-objective optimization for drug-like properties (efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics)
- Generative models for novel molecular design

**Clinical Machine Learning Applications**
- Interpretable deep learning models for clinical risk prediction
- Dynamic prediction systems for postoperative complications
- Frailty assessment and geriatric care optimization
- Mental health risk stratification (postpartum depression, perioperative anxiety)

**Computational Pharmacology**
- PK/PD modeling using machine learning approaches
- Drug-drug interaction prediction
- Population pharmacokinetics analysis

**Public Health Informatics**
- Epidemiological trend analysis and forecasting
- Health economics evaluation and cost-effectiveness modeling
- Disease burden assessment using global health data
