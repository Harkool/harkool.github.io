Biography
======
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/ssfzx/zygc/index.psp) (since September 2024). My doctoral research is supervised by Academician [Guangji Wang](https://www.cae.cn/cae/html/main/colys/41733597.html) (principal supervisor), Professor [Guo Yu](https://ygl.cpu.edu.cn/gmis5/dsfc/dsfcgrxx/D505D9EA25B7E8E3FCA77DEC1F03C908), and Professor [De-chuan Zhan](https://www.yuque.com/zhandc/home/nk8z4o) (School of Artificial Intelligence, [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/)).

● **Sep 2024 – Present**: Ph.D. Candidate, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/ssfzx/zygc/index.psp).

*Supervisors: Academician Guangji Wang (principal), Prof. Guo Yu, Prof. De-chuan Zhan*

● **Sep 2021 – Jun 2024**: Master of Pharmacy, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/ssfzx/zygc/index.psp).

*Supervisor: Associate Chief Pharmacist [Jianjun Zou](https://www.njsdyyy.com.cn/yiji/yaoxuebu/zhuanjiajieshao/2018-08-31/2668.html) ([Nanjing First Hospital](https://www.capturethefracture.org/fls/nanjingshidiyiyiyuan))*

● **Sep 2016-Jun 2021**: B.Sc. in Life Sciences and Biopharmaceuticals, [Shenyang Pharmaceutical University](https://www.syphu.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
------
My research primarily focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to healthcare, clinical problems, and drug discovery, including:

● **Drug discovery for undruggable/difficult-to-drug targets** (primary direction): Computational identification, design, and optimization of therapeutic peptides, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), using multimodal deep learning, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, multi-objective optimization, and generative models

● Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) modeling and prediction using machine learning approaches

● Clinical risk prediction models (e.g., postoperative complications, depression, frailty assessment)

● Interpretable and dynamic deep learning for medical decision support

● Machine learning applications in public health and epidemiology

● Pharmacoeconomics and health economics evaluation
